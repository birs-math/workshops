Dear <%= @contact_organizers_names.empty? ? 'organizers' : @contact_organizers_names %>,

In reviewing our registration database for <%= @event.location %> Workshop <%= @event.code %>, you currently have <%= @confirmed_count %> confirmed on-site participants and <%= @invited_count %> invited on-site participants who have not replied.

This leaves you <%= @physical_spots %> available on-site spots. We encourage you to issue new invites to suitable candidates at your earliest convenience.

Thank you and let us know if any questions.

Best regards,

<%= @program_coordinator %>
